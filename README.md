# crypto_exchange_rate_pull_py

A collection of python scripts used to pull the BID/ASK on various coins across exchanges and compare them looking for trading oppurtunities.

These were written and used in 2014 and are no longer viable, but the code for some of the exchanges still allows price pulls.
